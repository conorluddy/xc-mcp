# LLM Optimization Patterns for XC-MCP Tools

This document outlines strategies to optimize XC-MCP tools specifically for LLM/AI agent usage, following context engineering principles to maximize agent effectiveness within token constraints.

## Core Principles

1. **Predictable Naming** - Enable agents to reason about and reference resources
2. **Structured Metadata** - Make it easy for agents to parse and understand states
3. **Minimal Noise** - Return only signal, hide implementation details
4. **Progressive Disclosure** - Provide summaries upfront, details on demand
5. **Semantic Grouping** - Organize outputs so agents can batch operations
6. **Cacheable Artifacts** - Create reusable reference points for multi-step workflows

## Phase 3 Tools - LLM Optimization Patterns

### 1. Screenshot Naming Convention

**Current:** Random filenames like `simulator_screenshot_2025-01-23T12-34-56.png`

**Optimized:** Semantic naming with screen context
```
Format: {appName}_{screenName}_{state}_{timestamp}.png

Examples:
- MyApp_LoginScreen_Empty_2025-01-23.png
- MyApp_HomeView_Loading_2025-01-23.png
- MyApp_DetailView_Success_2025-01-23.png
- MyApp_ErrorState_NetworkError_2025-01-23.png
- MyApp_SettingsView_Filled_2025-01-23.png
```

**Benefits for Agents:**
- Agents can reason about which screen they're looking at
- Easy to reference in prompts: "Review MyApp_LoginScreen_Empty.png"
- Batch screenshots by view: `grep "LoginScreen" screenshots/`
- Track state progression: `ls MyApp_*_2025-01-23.png`

**Implementation:**
```typescript
// Request additional metadata from developer or infer from app structure
interface ScreenshotOptions {
  udid: string;
  outputPath?: string;
  // NEW: Semantic metadata
  appName?: string;
  screenName?: string;  // "LoginScreen", "HomeView", "DetailView"
  state?: string;       // "Empty", "Loading", "Success", "Error", "Filled"
}

// Generate filename
const filename = appName && screenName && state
  ? `${appName}_${screenName}_${state}_${date}.png`
  : `screenshot_${timestamp}.png`;
```

---

### 2. Video Recording with Scene Markers

**Current:** Single continuous video file

**Optimized:** Videos with embedded metadata and scene boundaries
```typescript
interface VideoOptions {
  udid: string;
  outputPath?: string;
  // NEW: Segmentation and metadata
  sceneMarkers?: boolean;  // Insert markers at app state changes
  splitByScene?: boolean;  // Output separate video per scene
  metadata?: {
    appName: string;
    testScenario: string;  // "LoginFlow", "OnboardingFlow", "ErrorHandling"
    actions: Array<{
      timestamp: number;
      action: string;  // "Tap LoginButton", "EnterPassword", "NetworkError"
      description: string;
    }>;
  };
}
```

**Benefits:**
- Agents can reference specific moments: "See video at 0:23 when user taps login"
- Supports automated video analysis with clear boundaries
- Enables playback of specific flows: `video_LoginFlow_2025-01-23.mp4`

---

### 3. Test Result Summaries with Structured Comparison

**Current:** Raw stdout/stderr from app

**Optimized:** Structured diff between expected and actual states
```typescript
interface AppStateSummary {
  timestamp: string;
  appName: string;
  screenName: string;

  // What agents need to understand the current state
  uiElements: Array<{
    id: string;
    type: "Button" | "TextField" | "Label" | "Image";
    text?: string;
    state: "enabled" | "disabled" | "loading" | "error";
    visibility: "visible" | "hidden";
  }>;

  // For debugging and comparison
  expectedVsActual?: {
    expected: AppStateSummary;
    differences: Array<{
      element: string;
      expectedState: string;
      actualState: string;
      severity: "critical" | "warning" | "info";
    }>;
  };

  // For progress tracking
  metrics: {
    loadTimeMs?: number;
    errorCount: number;
    warningCount: number;
  };
}
```

---

### 4. Media Library with Descriptive Indexing

**Current:** Raw list of media files added

**Optimized:** Indexed media collection with semantic categories
```typescript
interface MediaLibraryIndex {
  timestamp: string;
  appName: string;

  media: Array<{
    filename: string;
    path: string;
    type: "image" | "video";

    // Semantic classification for agent reasoning
    category: "portrait" | "landscape" | "screenshot" | "artwork" | "video";
    contentType: "photo" | "illustration" | "diagram" | "video_clip" | "animation";

    // For agent decision-making
    purpose: "testing_profile_image" | "testing_gallery_view" | "stress_testing";
    metadata: {
      dimensions?: string;  // "1024x768"
      duration?: string;    // "5s" for videos
      format: string;       // "jpg", "mp4"
      sizeKb: number;
    };
  }>;

  // Enable agent queries like:
  // "Get all portrait images for profile testing"
  // "Find video clips under 10MB"
  // "List all gallery test media"
  summary: {
    totalItems: number;
    byCategory: Record<string, number>;
    byPurpose: Record<string, number>;
    totalSizeMb: number;
  };
}
```

**Benefits:**
- Agents can reason about which media to add for different scenarios
- Enables batch operations: "Use all landscape images for landscape testing"
- Supports validation: "Media library has 3 portrait images for profile test"

---

### 5. Privacy/Permission Changes with Audit Trail

**Current:** Success/failure for each permission change

**Optimized:** Complete permission state snapshot with change log
```typescript
interface PermissionAuditEntry {
  timestamp: string;
  appName: string;
  bundleId: string;

  // Current complete state
  currentPermissions: Record<string, "granted" | "denied" | "unknown">;
  // camera, microphone, location, contacts, photos, calendar, health, etc.

  // Change that was made
  change: {
    service: string;
    action: "grant" | "revoke" | "reset";
    timestamp: string;
    success: boolean;
  };

  // Previous state for comparison
  previousPermissions?: Record<string, "granted" | "denied" | "unknown">;

  // For test reproducibility
  testContext?: {
    scenario: string;  // "LocationTest", "CameraOnboarding", "PermissionDenial"
    step: number;
    expectedBehavior: string;
  };
}
```

**Benefits:**
- Agents can verify permission state: "Camera should be denied for this test"
- Enables rollback: "Reset all permissions to initial state"
- Supports audit: "Track all permission changes in this test session"

---

### 6. Push Notification with Delivery Confirmation and Impact Tracking

**Current:** Sent/not sent binary result

**Optimized:** Full delivery tracking with app response recording
```typescript
interface PushNotificationRecord {
  timestamp: string;
  appName: string;
  bundleId: string;

  // What was sent
  payload: {
    alert?: string;
    badge?: number;
    sound?: string;
    customData?: Record<string, any>;
    priority: "normal" | "high";
  };

  // Delivery confirmation
  delivery: {
    sent: boolean;
    receivedByApp: boolean;
    sentAt: string;
    receivedAt?: string;
    delayMs?: number;
  };

  // App behavior after notification
  appResponse?: {
    userWasNotified: boolean;  // Did UI show notification?
    appLaunchTriggered: boolean;
    deeplinkFollowed?: boolean;
    dataProcessed: boolean;
    screenChangeDetected?: string;  // "HomeScreen", "DetailView"
  };

  // For test verification
  testContext?: {
    testName: string;  // "PushNotification_DeepLinkTest"
    expectedBehavior: string;
    actualBehavior: string;
    passed: boolean;
  };
}
```

**Benefits:**
- Agents can verify notifications were actually processed
- Track side effects: "Did deep link navigate to correct screen?"
- Enable regression testing: "Compare with previous push test results"

---

### 7. Clipboard Operations with Content Type and Validation

**Current:** Text copied to clipboard with no verification

**Optimized:** Structured clipboard operations with validation
```typescript
interface ClipboardOperation {
  timestamp: string;
  appName: string;
  bundleId: string;

  // What was copied
  operation: "copy" | "paste";
  content: {
    text: string;
    contentType: "text" | "url" | "json" | "csv" | "html" | "markdown";
    encoding: "utf-8" | "ascii";
    lengthBytes: number;
    lineCount?: number;
  };

  // Validation
  validation?: {
    expectedFormat: string;  // e.g., "email", "url", "json_object"
    isValid: boolean;
    validationErrors?: string[];
  };

  // Verification that app can access it
  appAccess?: {
    appAttemptedAccess: boolean;
    accessTime?: string;
    processedSuccessfully: boolean;
    uiReflectedChange: boolean;
  };

  // Test context
  testPurpose: string;  // "CopyURL", "PasteCredentials", "ShareContent"
}
```

**Benefits:**
- Agents can verify paste operations succeeded
- Validate content format before pasting
- Track if app actually processed clipboard content
- Enable clipboard-based workflows: "Copy share URL, paste in chat test"

---

### 8. Status Bar State Snapshots

**Current:** Override succeeded/failed with no verification

**Optimized:** Before/after state snapshots for verification
```typescript
interface StatusBarSnapshot {
  timestamp: string;
  appName: string;
  bundleId: string;

  operation: "override" | "clear";

  // Before state
  before: {
    time?: string;
    dataNetwork?: string;
    wifiMode?: string;
    batteryState?: string;
    batteryLevel?: number;
    screenshot?: string;  // path to screenshot showing real status bar
  };

  // After state
  after: {
    time?: string;
    dataNetwork?: string;
    wifiMode?: string;
    batteryState?: string;
    batteryLevel?: number;
    screenshot?: string;  // path to screenshot showing overridden status bar
  };

  // Verification
  verification?: {
    visuallyVerified: boolean;
    screenshotFilename: string;  // e.g., "StatusBar_Override_9-41_2025-01-23.png"
    appliedSuccessfully: boolean;
  };

  // Test context
  testScenario: string;  // "LowBattery", "NoSignal", "NoWiFi", "Charging"
}
```

**Benefits:**
- Agents can verify status bar changes visually
- Enable UI layout testing: "Test with low battery status bar"
- Compare screenshots: "Verify status bar matches expected state"

## Global Optimization Patterns

### 1. Structured Session Logging

```typescript
interface SessionLog {
  sessionId: string;
  appName: string;
  bundleId: string;
  startTime: string;
  endTime?: string;
  simulator: {
    udid: string;
    name: string;
  };

  // Timeline of all operations
  operations: Array<{
    timestamp: string;
    type: "launch" | "screenshot" | "input" | "permission" | "push" | "media";
    description: string;
    success: boolean;
    artifactPath?: string;  // Path to screenshot, video, etc.
  }>;

  // Enable workflow reconstruction
  summary: {
    totalOperations: number;
    successRate: number;
    artifactsGenerated: string[];
    errors: Array<{
      timestamp: string;
      operation: string;
      error: string;
    }>;
  };
}
```

**Benefits:**
- Agents can replay sessions: "Repeat all operations from session_abc123"
- Track workflow: "Which screenshots were taken before this error?"
- Analyze patterns: "All failures were after 5 operations"

### 2. Artifact Index with References

```typescript
interface ArtifactIndex {
  // Organize all generated files for easy agent access
  screenshots: {
    byApp: Record<string, string[]>;      // MyApp -> [file1.png, file2.png]
    byScreen: Record<string, string[]>;    // LoginScreen -> [file1.png, file2.png]
    byState: Record<string, string[]>;     // Loading -> [file1.png, file2.png]
    byDate: Record<string, string[]>;      // 2025-01-23 -> [file1.png, file2.png]
  };

  videos: {
    byScenario: Record<string, string>;    // LoginFlow -> video.mp4
    byDate: Record<string, string[]>;
  };

  logs: {
    byOperationType: Record<string, string[]>;  // "permission" -> [log1, log2]
    sessionLogs: string[];
  };

  // Enable queries like:
  // "Get all MyApp_LoginScreen screenshots from today"
  // "Find LoadingState screenshots"
  // "List all error logs"
}
```

### 3. Operation Chaining with Explicit Dependencies

```typescript
interface OperationChain {
  chainId: string;
  description: string;  // "Login and view profile flow"

  steps: Array<{
    stepId: string;
    operation: string;
    description: string;

    // Dependencies
    dependsOn?: string[];  // stepIds

    // Configuration
    config: any;

    // Verification
    expectedOutcome: string;
    verificationScreenshot?: string;
  }>;

  // Enable agent reasoning:
  // "Step 2 failed because Step 1 didn't complete"
  // "Screenshots from steps 1-3 show successful login flow"
}
```

## Example: Optimized Login Test Flow

### Before (Current):
```
Agent takes screenshot -> random_image_2025-01-23T12-34-56.png
Agent launches app -> success
Agent enters text -> no feedback on what was typed
Agent takes screenshot -> random_image_2025-01-23T12-35-01.png
Agent taps login -> success or failure
```

### After (Optimized):
```
Agent takes screenshot -> MyApp_LoginScreen_Empty_2025-01-23.png
  ✓ Artifact indexed under {app: MyApp, screen: LoginScreen, state: Empty}
  ✓ Referenced in session log

Agent launches app -> success (session started, operation logged)
  ✓ SessionLog tracks this as operation #1

Agent enters email -> clipboard op recorded
  ✓ ClipboardOperation shows: content="user@example.com", verified valid email
  ✓ Referenced in session log

Agent takes screenshot -> MyApp_LoginScreen_Filled_2025-01-23.png
  ✓ Agent can compare with Empty state
  ✓ Indexed under state: Filled

Agent taps login button -> success
  ✓ Next expected state: loading or home screen
  ✓ SessionLog predicts next screenshot should show MyApp_HomeScreen

Agent takes screenshot -> MyApp_HomeScreen_Success_2025-01-23.png
  ✓ Agent validates: "Expected HomeScreen, got HomeScreen ✓"
  ✓ Can compare with previous successful login from session_xyz

SESSION COMPLETE:
- ArtifactIndex shows: 3 screenshots, organized by app/screen/state
- SessionLog shows: 6 operations, 100% success rate
- All artifacts are named semantically and easy to reference
- Agent can reason: "LoginFlow was successful, all states progressed as expected"
```
