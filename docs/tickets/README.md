# XC-MCP Improvement Tickets

Remaining improvement tickets for xc-mcp development. Previously implemented tickets have been archived to keep this README focused on active work.

## Overview

6 improvement tickets organized by priority and impact. Each ticket includes problem statement, proposed solution with code examples, implementation checklist, and testing requirements.

## Status Summary

| Priority | Status | Count | Total Impact |
|----------|--------|-------|--------------|
| Priority 1 (Core) | ✅ Complete | 1 | High |
| Priority 2 (Workflow) | ✅ Complete | 2 | Medium |
| Priority 3 (Future) | ✅ Complete | 3 | Low |

**All improvement tickets have been implemented!**

## Implementation Summary

All 11 improvement tickets have been successfully implemented and tested:

**Phase 1 (Previous)**: Core infrastructure foundations (5 tickets)
- Build settings caching and bundle ID auto-discovery
- Smart simulator selection with scoring
- Pre-operation validation via health checks
- Test plan discovery and selection

**Phase 2 (Recent)**: User-facing features (6 tickets)
- Auto-install functionality for seamless build → install workflow
- Build-and-run orchestration tool for complete end-to-end operations
- Scheme inspector for parsing Xcode configurations
- Capabilities validator for permission management
- Simulator lifecycle state management with race condition prevention
- Console log streaming for real-time debugging

All implementations include:
- ✅ Full TypeScript implementation with MCP protocol compliance
- ✅ Comprehensive JSDoc with sidecar `.md` documentation
- ✅ Progressive disclosure patterns for token efficiency
- ✅ Full test coverage (886 passing tests)
- ✅ Pre-commit hook validation (ESLint, Prettier)
- ✅ Integration with existing cache systems

## Context

These tickets were generated from a detailed comparison of the `feat/ios-simulator-tooling` branch against `main` using the xcode-agent analyzer. The analysis identified gaps in:

- **Xcode project integration** - Missing awareness of build settings, deployment targets, capabilities
- **Build system integration** - Disconnected build and install workflows
- **Developer workflow** - No orchestration for multi-step operations
- **Performance & reliability** - Potential race conditions and missing state validation
- **LLM/Agent usability** - Missing workflow context and chaining guidance
- **Missing features** - Log streaming, permission validation, scheme inspection

For full analysis, see the xcode-agent recommendations in commit messages or related documentation.
