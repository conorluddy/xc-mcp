## Advantages

‚Ä¢ Force fresh data after major Xcode project changes (new targets, schemes, build settings)
‚Ä¢ Resolve issues caused by stale cached simulator or project data
‚Ä¢ Clear memory before performance testing to establish baseline
‚Ä¢ Reset learned patterns when switching between project configurations

## Parameters

### Required
- cacheType (string): Which cache to clear - "simulator", "project", "response", or "all"

### Optional
- (None)

## Returns

- Tool execution results with clear operation confirmation
- Results per cache type showing successful clearing
- Timestamp of cache clearing
